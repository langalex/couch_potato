h2. Couch Potato

... is a persistence layer written in ruby for CouchDB.

h3. Mission

The goal of Couch Potato is to create a migration path for users of ActiveRecord and other object relational mappers to port their applications to CouchDB. It therefore offers a basic set of the functionality provided by most ORMs and adds functionality unique to CouchDB on top.

h3. Core Features

Couch Potato is a work in progress so this list will hopefully grow over time.

* persisting objects by including the CouchPotato::Persistence module
* has_many/belongs_to relationships between persistant objects
* atomic write operations spanning multiple objects using bulk save queues
* extensive spec suite
* included versioning support via the CouchPotato::Versioning module
* included ordered lists support via the CouchPotato::Ordering module

h3. Introduction

This is a basic tutorial on how to use Couch Potato. If you want to know all the details feel free to read the specs.

h4. Save, load objects

First you need a class.

  class User
  end

To make instances of this class persistent include the persistence module:

  class User
    include CouchPotato::Persistence
  end

If you want to store any properties you have to declare them:

  class User
    include CouchPotato::Persistence
    
    property :name
  end

Now you can save your objects:

  user = User.new :name => 'joe'
  user.save # or save!

Properties:

  user.name # => 'joe'
  user.name = {:first => ['joe', 'joey'], :last => 'doe', :middle => 'J'} # you can set any ruby object that responds_to :to_json (includes all core objects)
  user._id # => "02097f33a0046123f1ebc0ebb6937269"
  user._rev # => "2769180384"
  user.created_at # => Fri Oct 24 19:05:54 +0200 2008
  user.updated_at # => Fri Oct 24 19:05:54 +0200 2008
  user.new_document? # => false, for compatibility new_record? will work as well

You can of course also retrieve your instance:

  User.get "02097f33a0046123f1ebc0ebb6937269" # => <#User 0x3075>

h4. Object validations

Couch Potato uses the validatable library for vaidation (http://validatable.rubyforge.org/)\

  class User
    property :name
    validates_presence_of :name
  end

  user = User.new
  user.valid? # => false
  user.errors.on(:name) # => [:name, 'can't be blank']

h4. Finding stuff

For running finds (e.g. creating/querying views) as of now there is only the CouchPotato::Persistence::Finder class which allows you do basic searches:

  user = User.create! :first_name => 'joe'
  Finder.new.find User, :first_name => 'joe' # => [user]
  
You can also count:

  user = User.create! :first_name => 'joe'
  Finder.new.count User, :first_name => 'joe' # => 1
  

Be warned though that executing this find method will generate a new view for every new combination of class and attribute names it gets called with, so you really don't want to use this in a console on a production system.

Support for more sophisticated views will be added later.

h4. Associations

As of now has_many and belongs_to are supported. By default the associated objects are stored in separate documents linked via foreign keys just like in relational databases.

  class User
    has_many :addresses, :dependent => :destroy
  end
  
  class Address
    belongs_to :user
    property :street
  end
  
   user = User.new
  user.addresses.build :street => 'potato way'
  user.addresses.first # => <#Address 0x987>
  user.addresses.create! # raises an exception as street is blank
  user.addresses.first.user == user # => true

As CouchDB can not only store flat structures you also store associations inline:

  class User
    has_many :addresses, :stored => :inline
  end

This will store the addresses of the user as an array within your CouchDB document.

h5. callbacks

Couch Potato supports the usual lifecycle callbacks known from ActiveRecord:

  class User
    include CouchPotato::Persistence
    
    before_create :do_something_before_create
    after_update :do_something_else
  end

This will call the method do_something_before_create before creating an object and do_something_else after updating one. Supported callbacks are: :before_validation_on_create, :before_validation_on_update, :before_validation_on_save, :before_create, :after_create, :before_update, :after_update, :before_save, :after_save, :before_destroy, :after_destroy

If you want to do any CouchDB update/create/delete operation in your callback methods...

  class User
    include CouchPotato::Persistence
    has_many :comments
    
    before_update :create_a_comment
    
    private    
    def create_a_comment
      comments.create :body => 'i was updated'
    end
  end

... and you want the entire operation including its hooks to be atomic you can do this:

  class User
    include CouchPotato::Persistence
    has_many :comments
    
    before_update :create_a_comment
    
    private    
    def create_a_comment
      bulk_save_queue << Comment.new(:body => 'i was updated')
    end
  end


h4. Versioning

Couch Potato supports versioning your objects, very similar to the popular acts_as_versioned plugin for ActiveRecord. To use it include the module:

  class Document
    include CouchPotato::Persistence
    include CouchPotato::Versioning
  end

After that your object will have a version that gets incremented on each save.

  doc = Document.create
  doc.version # => 1
  doc.save
  doc.version # => 2

You can access the older versions via the versions method.

  doc.versions.first.version # => 1

When passing a version number the version method will only return that version:

  doc.versions(1).version # => 1

You can set a condition for when to create a new version:

  class Document
    attr_accessor :update_version
    include CouchPotato::Persistence
    include CouchPotato::Versioning
    
    set_version_condition lambda {|doc| doc.update_version}
  end

  doc = Document.create
  doc.update_version = false
  doc.version # => 1
  doc.save
  doc.version # => 1
  doc.update_version = true
  doc.save
  doc.version # => 2
  
h4. Ordered Lists

Couch Potato supports ordered lists for has_many relationships (with the :stored => :separately option only), very similar to the popular acts_as_list plugin for ActiveRecord. To use it include the module:

  class PersistenArray
    include CouchPotato::Persistence
    has_many :items
  end
  
  class Item
    include CouchPotato::Ordering
    belongs_to :persistent_array
    set_ordering_scope :persistent_array_id
  end
  
  array = PersistenArray.new
  item1 = array.items.create!
  item1.position # => 1
  item2 = array.items.create!
  item2.position # => 2
  
You can move items up and down simply by changing the position:

  item2.position = 1
  item2.save!
  item1.position # => 2
  
And you can insert new items at any position you want:

  item3 = array.items.create! :position => 2
  item1.position # => 3
  
And remove:

  item3.destroy
  item1.position # => 2

h3. Helping out

Please fix bugs, add more specs, implement new features by forking the github repo at http://github.com/langalex/couch_potato.

You can run all the specs by calling rake with no options in the root folder of Couch Potato. The specs require a running CouchDB instance at http://localhost:5984

I will only accept patches that are covered by specs - sorry.
